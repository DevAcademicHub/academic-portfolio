# üìù Draft Branch Protection Test

## Additional Changes for Testing
This file creates a meaningful difference between the test branch and draft branch.

## Test Scenario
- **Source**: test/academic-protection-validation
- **Target**: draft (academic review process)
- **Purpose**: Validate branch protection and PR workflow

## Changes Made
- Added this additional test file
- Created content difference for PR comparison
- Testing academic workflow from development to draft

## Expected Behavior
1. PR should be creatable now (content difference exists)
2. Branch protection should prevent direct pushes to draft
3. Documentation workflow should execute
4. Academic review process should be enforced
